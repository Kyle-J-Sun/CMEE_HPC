## What is Neutral Theory?

- Assumes all individuals are ecologicall equivalent
- An example of an individual based model

  - fundamental components of the model: Indiv organisms `instead of` species

- Some misunderstanding in terms of Neutral Theory:
  - Neutral model is NOT a null model
    > Null model is a model using in `statistics`, neutral model is a `mechanistic model` in ecology (maybe used as a null model, but not necessarily)
  - Neutral model does NOT assume the `species` are the same.
    > Nuetral models assume that `all individuals` are the same instead of species
  - The demographic properties of an individual are `independent` of its species indentity
  - A model in which species are interchagneable is NOT always nuetral.

## Neutral Models (Examples)
### Process of Neutral Models

- Individual dies `at random`
- Leaving gap in the community
- The gap filled with the offspring of another indiv. `chosen at random`
> We may have new species enterring into the system and filling the gap (Occationally)

### Voter Model
- **Process of Voter Model**
     - Pick a random neighbor
     - Taking their view or they take yours
     - *Occasionally someone introduces a new view*

- **The Results of Voter Model**
     - Without any new ideas being injected into the system, eventually everyone holds the same view.
     - This is a `dynamic equlibrium`.

- **Variations on the theme**
     - The zero sum assumption
          - A indiv. has to be died before another indiv to be born
          - The total number of indiv are the same
     - Speciation mode (Random fission/protracted)
     - Spatial structure (Non spatial/spatially implicit)
